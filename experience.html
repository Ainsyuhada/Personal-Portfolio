<p> This story begins where my friends and I are cycling on the campus of Uitm Machang. At first everyone couldn't wait to ride the bike because we were so stressed with so many assignments. While we were pedaling, there was a friend of mine who noticed our behavior on the bike and we asked her why not join once. Then she told me that she was not good at cycling. So we all taught her to ride a bike. I taught her to slowly land for fears she would fall. Then, she was good at cycling and he was so excited to ride a bike. Shortly afterwards, she rode his bicycle so fast that she fell and seriously injured him. My friends and I feel very guilty about the incident.</p>
